"Awesome books" is a simple website that displays a list of books and allows you to add and remove books from that list.

### First requirements:

Project requirements

    Implement only a basic UI with plain HTML:

Basic UI

    Create a collection that keeps a list of books (hint: you can use an array of objects for that).
    Create a function to add a new book to the collection, with title and author.
    Create a function to remove a book from the collection (hint: you can use the array filter() method).
    Display all books saved in the collection in the top part of the page.
    Make sure that when a user clicks the "Add" button:
        A new book is added to the collection.
        The new book is displayed in the page.
    Make sure that when a user clicks the "Remove" button:
        The correct book is removed from the collection.
        The correct book dissapears from the page.
    Make sure that data is preserved in the browser's memory by using localStorage.
    To debug your application, you can use console.log(). Remember to remove debugging code before pushing your code to the remote repository.
    Don't use any library or framework, use only plain JavaScript.

TIP: If you separated the code in multiple files and you you have the following issues with the linter: complaining about having multiple classes at the same file, or an unused variables, disable the linter check for that rule in the file with a /* eslint-disable rule-you-want-to-disable */ .

Check the ESLint documentation for more details on how.
